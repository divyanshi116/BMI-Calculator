## üìù Code Overview

### BMI Calculation Logic

The BMI is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\left(\frac{\text{Height (cm)}}{100}\right)^2} \]

**Example Code Snippet from `script.js`:**
```javascript
var bmi = weight / ((height / 100) ** 2);
var category = "";
if (bmi < 18.5) {
  category = "Underweight";
} else if (bmi < 25) {
  category = "Normal weight";
} else if (bmi < 30) {
  category = "Overweight";
} else {
  category = "Obese";
}
resultDiv.innerHTML = "Your BMI is " + bmi.toFixed(2) + " (" + category + ")";
```

### Styling Highlights

The app uses **Google Fonts** for typography and provides hover effects for buttons and containers for a modern and dynamic experience. It includes responsive design to adapt to small screens.

**Example Code Snippet from `style.css`:**
```css
.container {
    max-width: 400px;
    padding: 30px;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 6px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    text-align: center;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
}
.container:hover {
    transform: translateY(-5px);
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```
